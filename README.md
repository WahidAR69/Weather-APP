# Weather-APP
# Edureka Projects

This repository contains one of the other projects that I have worked on during my time at Edureka.

## Project 2: Weather App

The second project is a weather app that fetches weather conditions of cities around the globe from an API and displays it to the user. The user can search for a city, and if the city is valid, the app will display all the weather condition properties. This project was built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to make it functional.
